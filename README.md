# medical-datasets
I list all the medical data sets I find in my researches.

## IMAGES

* Zhao et al. have released a COVID19-CT dataset, with detailed descriptions. 
You can find it [here](https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT).

* Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment (PANDA) is a challenge on the Kaggle, so you can find the data and description [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment/overview)

* There are 3 challenges for aneurysm detection, segmentation and rupture risk estimation. You can find the challenge [here](https://cada.grand-challenge.org/Introduction/). Registration may be needed.

* The AutoImplant challenge where a fast and automatic design of cranial implants is highly desired. You can find the challenge information [here](https://autoimplant.grand-challenge.org/). Registration may be needed.

* DFU challenge is a repository of 4500 DFU images for the purpose of supporting research toward more advanced methods of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) detection. You can access the data [here](https://dfu2020.grand-challenge.org/). Registration may be needed.

* KNee OsteoArthritis Prediction (KNOAP2020) Challenge is about identifying which knees will develop symptomatic radiographic knee osteoarthritis within 6.5 years follow-up. More information is provided [here](https://knoap2020.grand-challenge.org/Home/). Registration may be needed.

* The Learn2reg challenge, which builds on a popular [tutorial](https://learn2reg.github.io) in 2019, will be a simplified challenge design that removes many of the common pitfalls for learning and applying transformations. The data can either be individually or comprehensively addressed by participants and cover both intra- and inter-patient alignment, CT, ultrasound and MRI modalities, neuro-, thorax and abdominal anatomies and the four of the imminent challenges of medical image registration:
  1. learning from small datasets
  2. estimating large deformations
  3. dealing with multi-modal scans
  4. learning from noisy annotations
  you can find more information [here](https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org/).



## Surgical data science

* SurgVisDom - Surgical Visual Domain Adaptation 2020, [here](https://surgvisdom.grand-challenge.org/Home/).

* The [SARAS](www.saras-project.eu) (Smart Autonomous Robotic Assistant Surgeon) is working towards replacing the assistant surgeon. An artificial intelligence based system is required which not only can understand the complete surgical scene but also detect the actions being performed by the main surgeon. This challenge has recorded four sessions of complete prostatectomy procedure performed by expert surgeons on real patients with prostate cancer. Later, expert AI and medical professions annotated these complete surgical procedures for the actions. Hence, each frame is labeled for multiple actions and these actions can have overlapping bounding boxes. You can find more information about this interesting challenge [here](https://saras-esad.grand-challenge.org/).


## Other
*  Radar signatures of human activities includes radar signatures of different indoor human activities performed by different people in different locations. [here](http://researchdata.gla.ac.uk/848/) you can find more information.
